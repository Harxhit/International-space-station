# International Space Station Ovehead üõ∞Ô∏è
## Project Description:
Developed a Python-based program that utilizes APIs to notify users via email when the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead during nighttime hours. The program leverages real-time data to provide accurate alerts, enhancing the user's stargazing experience.

## Key Features:

### Real-time ISS Tracking: 
Uses the Open Notify API to track the current position of the ISS.
### Nighttime Detection: 
Integrates the Sunrise-Sunset API to determine local sunrise and sunset times, ensuring notifications are only sent during nighttime.
### Email Notifications: 
Automatically sends an email alert when the ISS is overhead, allowing users to observe it in the night sky.
## Technologies Used:

### Programming Language: Python
## APIs:
#### Open Notify API for ISS location data
#### Sunrise-Sunset API for calculating sunrise and sunset times
## Libraries:
#### requests for making HTTP requests to APIs
#### smtplib for sending email notifications
#### datetime for handling date and time operations
#### time for setting intervals between checks
## Technical Skills Demonstrated:

### API Integration: 
Implemented robust API calls and handled JSON responses to extract relevant data.
### Email Automation: 
Set up SMTP server configurations to automate email sending.
### Real-time Data Processing: 
Processed real-time data to determine the ISS position and local time conditions.
### Error Handling:
Incorporated error handling for API requests to ensure program stability and reliability.
## Challenges Overcome:
Ensuring accurate synchronization between real-time ISS position and local time conditions.
Handling edge cases for sunrise and sunset times to prevent false notifications.
Securely managing email credentials and protecting user data.
## Outcome:
Successfully developed a functional program that enhances user engagement with space observation by providing timely and accurate notifications of the ISS's visibility.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, API integration, and automation, showcasing the ability to develop real-time applications with practical use cases.
